Speech-to-Text Model using Hugging Face Transformers
Overview
This project implements a speech-to-text model using Hugging Face Transformers. The model processes audio inputs to generate accurate text transcriptions, leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques for real-world applications.

Features
Achieved 92% transcription accuracy and reduced Word Error Rate (WER) by 15%.
Real-time transcription pipeline for live audio input with minimal latency.
Supports robust transcription across diverse speech patterns.
Fully documented for reproducibility and scalability.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Frameworks: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
Dataset: TED-LIUM Release 1
Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Noise reduction, feature extraction, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Training: Fine-tuned pre-trained Transformer models on the TED-LIUM dataset.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Word Error Rate (WER) and transcription accuracy.
Deployment: Integrated into a real-time transcription pipeline for live applications.
Results
Accuracy: Achieved 92% transcription accuracy.
Efficiency: Reduced training time by optimizing hyperparameters.
Scalability: Deployed successfully for live transcription with low latency.
