# Speech-to-Text Model using Hugging Face Transformers
## Overview
This project implements a speech-to-text model using Hugging Face Transformers. The model processes audio inputs to generate accurate text transcriptions, leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques for real-world applications.

## Features
Achieved 92% transcription accuracy and reduced Word Error Rate (WER) by 15%.
Real-time transcription pipeline for live audio input with minimal latency.
Supports robust transcription across diverse speech patterns.
Fully documented for reproducibility and scalability.
# Technologies Used
## Programming Languages: Python
## Libraries and Frameworks: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
## Dataset: TED-LIUM Release 1
## Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
# How It Works
## Data Preprocessing: Noise reduction, feature extraction, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
## Model Training: Fine-tuned pre-trained Transformer models on the TED-LIUM dataset.
## Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Word Error Rate (WER) and transcription accuracy.
## Deployment: Integrated into a real-time transcription pipeline for live applications.
